# odin-landing-page

This project is a part of the The Odin Project, using CSS+Flexbox. In this project, I've tried to give the webpage a flavour of my own - making it my own website.

index.html contains the main html file of the homepage, whereas styles.css is the main stylesheet. Any images used on the webpage are in the images directory. 01 and 02.png are a part of the problem statement given by The Odin Project, and I've used them as reference to construct my webpage.
